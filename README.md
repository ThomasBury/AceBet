## Introduction

Have you ever wondered if it is possible to predict the outcome of a tennis match before the first serve? Our team has developed a web-based application called AceBet that does just that. This report provides an overview of the concept, features, and future plans for AceBet.

AceBet is built using the FastAPI framework and leverages machine learning to predict the outcome of tennis matches. The system includes user authentication for access control and provides endpoints for user interactions.

The following are some of the key features of AceBet:
* Predicts the outcome of tennis matches with high accuracy
* Provides the probability of each outcome
* Classifies the outcome of each match
* Includes user authentication for access control
* Offers endpoints for user interactions

AceBet is still under development, but we believe it has the potential to revolutionize the way people bet on tennis matches. We are excited to continue working on AceBet and to bring it to the market in the near future.

## Getting Started

1. Install the AceBet package by changing the directory where the package is located (`pyproject.toml`) and run `pip install -U.`
2. Fire up your crystal ball by running `uvicorn main:app --reload`.

## API Endpoints

Our AceBet has some exciting routes to visit:

- **/token**: This endpoint facilitates user authentication, issuing access tokens for secure interactions.
- **/users/me/**: It offers users access to their individual profiles, presenting user-specific information.
- **/users/me/items/**: This endpoint grants access to personalized collections of items associated with the user.
- **/predict/**: Users can utilize this endpoint to submit match prediction requests, supplying player names and match date.

## Authentication Magic

AceBet isn't open to just anyone. To access its secrets, you need an access token. Visit the `/token` route, share your credentials, and get your magical token for AceBet.

## Prediction

The `/predict` route is where the real magic happens. Provide player names and a match date, and AceBet's algorithms will predict the match outcome! You'll get the player's name, the probability of their victory, and the predicted class (0 or 1).

## AceBet-in-action

Initiating a match prediction involves sending a POST request, as depicted:

```bash
curl -X 'POST' \
  'http://127.0.0.1:8000/predict/' \
  -H 'accept: application/json' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{
  "p1_name": "Nadal",
  "p2_name": "Federer",
  "date": "2023-06-30"
}'
```

You'll receive predictions like:
```json
{
  "player_name": "Nadal",
  "prob": 73.5,
  "class_": 1
}
```

## More on the API architecture
Dependency injection is a design pattern that allows us to decouple our code from its dependencies. In FastAPI, dependencies are reusable components that can be injected into our endpoint functions. This means that we can write our endpoint functions without having to worry about how to get the data or services that they need. Instead, we can simply inject the dependencies that you need into the function.

This can be a great way to improve the modularity and flexibility of our code. It can also make our code easier to test and maintain.

For example, we injected a rate limiter into our endpoint functions. This allows us to limit the number of requests that can be made to the function per unit of time. This can help to prevent our API from being overloaded.

We could also inject a function that checks for duplicates into our endpoint functions. This would allow us to prevent users from submitting duplicate data.

## From Mock-up to Production

While AceBet is currently a mock-up, it's just the tip of the iceberg. The journey from mock-up to production involves:

1. **Refining the Models**: Enhance the predictive models with more data, fine-tuning, and advanced algorithms to improve accuracy.
2. **Scalability and Optimization**: Optimize the code for scalability, ensuring smooth performance even with high user loads.
3. **Security Enhancements**: Fortify the app with robust security measures to protect user data and ensure safe interactions.
4. **UI/UX Transformation**: Elevate the user experience with an engaging interface and intuitive interactions.
5. **Deployment and Monitoring**: Deploy the app on a production server, and set up monitoring to keep an eye on its health and performance.
6. **Continuous Improvement**: Regularly update and improve the app based on user feedback and changing requirements.
7. **Documentation**: Create comprehensive documentation for the app, including user guides, API documentation, and troubleshooting guides. This will help users to get the most out of the app. Using Sphinx for instance.

## Conclusion

AceBet, in its mock-up form, promises a glimpse into the world of match predictions. As we journey from mock-up to production, we're excited to transform it into a powerful tool that offers accurate predictions and an enchanting user experience. Stay tuned for more magical updates! ðŸŽ¾ðŸ”®

## Database preparation

The `dataprep.py` efficiently prepares ATP (Association of Tennis Professionals) data for predictive modeling. It starts by loading structured data into a DataFrame, then standardizes dates and reorganizes columns to align with modeling needs. It introduces practical feature enhancements, such as year, month, day, and rank difference. Swapping player columns ensures logical coherence. Finally, the processed data is stored for future use. This process establishes a solid foundation for subsequent predictive analysis in the realm of tennis match outcomes.
## Training procedure

The `train.py` segment presented orchestrates the process of training a machine learning model (ligthgbm) for AceBet Match Predictor. The pipeline commences with data preparation, where a specific time window is extracted from the ATP dataset, ranging from the `start_date` to the `end_date`. Features are then selected, excluding certain columns irrelevant to the task. This preprocessed data is subject to a `TimeSeriesSplit`, creating a division into training and test sets, with the former primarily utilized for model training.

The LightGBM classifier is used for predictive modeling (best, fastest and less prone to overfitting model, see the `atp_tennis.ipynb`), integrated within a pipeline along with an Ordinal Encoder to handle categorical variables. The model is trained on the training dataset, and upon completion, the pipeline is serialized and saved as a joblib file. This allows for easy model preservation and future utilization. Notably, the model's parameters are finely tuned for optimal performance, an essential aspect of the model's efficacy.

Though presented in a prototype phase, this segment encapsulates the essence of AceBet's machine learning engine. As the application progresses towards production, further refinements and optimizations are anticipated to enhance the model's predictive prowess, contributing to the project's ultimate goal of accurate match outcome prediction.

## Predict procedure

The `predict_winner.py` segment of code orchestrates the prediction process for a given match outcome after model training. First, loading the data from a Feather file, ensuring compatibility with the previous training data. The data is queried to extract relevant details for the specific players and match date.

Loading the latest trained model, the prediction function estimates the probability of Player 1 winning the match. The function returns the winning probability, the class prediction (0 or 1), and the name of Player 1. To facilitate the prediction process..

The model loading is executed through the `load_model` function, extracting the most recent model stored within a specified directory. Subsequently, the `make_prediction` function orchestrates the entire prediction procedure, from data loading to querying and prediction.

When executed independently, this segment demonstrates the prediction process for a specific match scenario. A test case is provided as a prototype, encapsulating the envisioned application's functionality. The printed result offers insights into Player 1's winning probability, a key facet of AceBet's capabilities. As the project advances towards production, further optimizations and scalability considerations are anticipated to enhance the prediction engine's accuracy and reliability.
