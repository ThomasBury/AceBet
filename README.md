```

 * notebooks/: Jupyter notebooks for data exploration, model training, and any other exploratory or experimental analyses. For pre-production steps.
 * src/: This folder holds the main source code .
     - api/: API-related files, including the main FastAPI file (main.py) and any additional files for defining API routes, request/response models, and authentication.
     - models/: Files related to machine learning models, such as model definitions (model.py), model training scripts, and any utilities specific to the models.
     - utils/: Utility functions or modules that provide common functionalities used across the project, such as data preprocessing, feature engineering, or custom metrics. It could be replaced by a python package.
     - tests/: Test files, such as unit tests for the API endpoints or model evaluation.
     - main.py: The main entry point of your application.
 * data/: Dataset and any other relevant data files required for training and testing your models. To be excluded from versioning (gitignore).
 * docker/: Docker-related files. 
     - Dockerfile: The Dockerfile specifies the environment and dependencies required to run the application. It defines the steps to build a Docker image.
     - docker-compose.yml: If we have multiple containers or services to run (e.g., the API, database), docker-compose.yml file to define and manage the composition of these services.
 * requirements.txt: Python dependencies required for your project, to install the necessary packages using pip. It could be a conda yaml.
 * README.md: A markdown file where you can provide a brief description of the project, installation instructions, usage guidelines, and any other relevant information. It could be broken down into CHANGELOG, etc.
